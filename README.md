<h1>$\large\textbf{\color{#4CAF50}{Features}}$</h1>

<h3>$\large\textbf{\color{#A5D6A7}{1. User Management \& Authentication}}$</h3>

- Easy sign-up for customers  
- Password recovery options  
- Different dashboards for different staff

---

<h3>$\large\textbf{\color{#C5E1A5}{2. Shopping \& Cart System}}$</h3>

**Key Features:**  
- Easy-to-navigate plant catalog  
- Save items for later purchase  

---

<h3>$\large\textbf{\color{#DCEDC8}{3. Plant Catalog}}$</h3>

- Smart filtering by plant type and needs  

---

<h3>$\large\textbf{\color{#E6EE9C}{4. Ratings \& Reviews System}}$</h3>
On this platform, customers can review plants or suggest them to others. They can also rate the plants so everyone can get accurate information. Additionally, they can interact with each other through real-time comments.  

---

<h3>$\large\textbf{\color{#FFF59D}{5. Discount \& Offer System}}$</h3>
GreenCart’s promotion tools make marketing easy and effective. Instead of just basic coupon codes, the system also offers:  
- Personalized discounts (for customers who left items in their cart)  
- Automatic reminders (with rewards for loyal customers, like those shopping for 1+ years)  
- Seasonal deals & special offers  

---

<h3>$\large\textbf{\color{#FFE082}{6. Order \& Delivery Management}}$</h3>
A smooth delivery process where customers get real-time updates and control over their orders.  
- Customers place an order, and a delivery agent is assigned to them.  
- The agent contacts the customer via chat or call to coordinate delivery.  
- After successful delivery, the payment status is marked as complete.  

---

<h3>$\large\textbf{\color{#FFCC80}{7. Admin Dashboard \& Analytics}}$</h3>
The admin dashboard gives business owners full control over their platform. From here, they can oversee orders, assign delivery staff, and manage salaries in one place. The system tracks inventory levels and sends automatic alerts when stock is running low. Admins can also monitor sales performance, check daily earnings, and identify growth opportunities—all through an easy-to-use interface.
